# Switched back to Ubuntu

I just wanted to get up and running with projects, not spend weeks and months configuring the OS / figuring out how to do things. NixOS's docs are lacking, making things harder. I loved the concept of NixOS with reproducible configuration for my computer. It's just not ready and documented enough for me to adopt yet.
